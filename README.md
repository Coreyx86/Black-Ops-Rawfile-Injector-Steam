# Black Ops Rawfile Injector Steam
 A tool to dump and overwrite/inject rawfile assets for SP/ZM & MP modes in Call of Duty: Black Ops [Steam]. 


 This tool uses data provided by the COD Engine Research Community (https://wiki.orbismodding.com/index.php/Main_Page) and Jake625. This tool also uses my open source MemoryLib API to interact with process memory in real-time.



# Current Features!

  - Dump rawfiles to folder
  - Overwrite existing rawfiles in real-time
  - Supports Singleplayer, Zombies, and Multiplayer

# Planned Features

  - Add the ability to view and edit the rawfiles from the tool itself. Similar to a real-time FF Viewer.

  - Bypass any RSA or data checks to allow all clients to join without having the same mod injected. [NOT SURE IF NECESSARY AS I HAVEN'T TESTED ONLINE WITH THIS AND DO NOT KNOW IF IT WORKS WITH ALL CLIENTS BUT BASED ON XBOX360 AND PS3 IT WILL BE NECESSARY]

  - Add PS3 and XBOX support


 # Again this is only for the STEAM version of Call of Duty: Black Ops.
